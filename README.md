## Overview

This is a personal project to learn Swift and UIKit by creating a prototype app.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- To improve my Swift programming skills
- To familiarize myself with the UIKit framework
- To create a functioning prototype which utilizes networking to pull data from an API
- To use UIKit components to display data to the app's user in a clear and concise way

## Progress

So far I have:

- Created the project in Xcode
- Set up the project's UI without using Storyboards
- Created dummy data to display in the UI

## Next Steps

The next steps for this project are:

- Created a network request to pull data from the API
- Displayed the information from the API in the app's UI
- Refine the app's UI
- Implement error handling
- Add more features to the app
